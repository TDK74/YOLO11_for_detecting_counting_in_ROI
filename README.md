# YOLO11 for detecting and counting of moving objects in Region Of Interest (ROI)
Inspired by Aarohi Singla's "Vehicle-detection-and-tracking-classwise-using-YOLO11" GitHub repository.

## 
Her Youtube tutorial on how to install OpenCV on NVIDIA Jetson Nano saved me a lot of time and headaches when I had certain struggles to install it a couple of years ago. I'll be always grateful to her for that.

## Setup Environment
* Laptop: Fujitsu Celcius H780
* Operating System: Windows 10 Pro x64
* Software: Python 3.8 (virtual env - workspace), 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 (Anaconda)
* Environment: Anaconda
* Object detection model: YOLO11m

See **_pip_freeze.txt_** for more details if interested.

## Notes
The code was refactored by me in certain extent.

The test video is not uploaded, because it is shaky and not professional, since it has been taken in the street by me. Use your own video instead or downloaded one from the Internet. Sorry!
