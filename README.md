## 
Her Youtube tutorial on how to install OpenCV on NVIDIA Jetson Nano saved me a lot of time and headaches when I had certain struggles to install it a couple of years ago. I'll be always grateful to her for that.

## Setup Environment
* Laptop: Fujitsu Celcius H780
* Operating System: Windows 10 Pro x64
* Software: Python 3.8 (virtual env - workspace), 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 (Anaconda)
* Environment: Anaconda
* Object detection model: YOLO11m

See **_pip_freeze.txt_** for more details if interested.

## Note
The code was refactored by me in certain extent.
